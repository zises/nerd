These form when moisture from a drippy glass or a hot dish gets trapped in the finish. To remove a long-standing stain, place a towel on top and press with a warm, dry iron for five to 10 seconds — this will soften the finish enough to release the moisture. Candle wax and crayon respond well to ice. Fill a plastic bag with ice cubes, wrap it in a towel, and place it on the stain until it hardens (a few minutes); carefully coax wax off with a plastic spatula or a credit card.
